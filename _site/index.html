<p>With this year’s FIRST Global Challenge starting in just two days we went on our way early in the morning to catch our flight to Mexico city.</p>

<p>Sadly, our flight had to be canceled because of technical issues. We ended up spending most of the day waiting at the airport before being able to go to a hotel and get some sleep.</p>

<p>Luckily, we will be able to fly to Mexico tomorrow and we should arrive on time for the competition. We are looking forward to meeting all the other teams there and wish everyone the best of luck in the upcoming games.</p>

<p>On day 5 and 6 we played our last six qualification matches. Before every round, we resolved issues with software and mechanical on our robot. In our last qualification match, our robot worked perfectly. We did not make it to the playoffs, but we had the best of times. We even got to meet Woodie Flowers and his wife at our pit. The best part was reserved for last. We received the first place award for International Enthusiasm. We are very happy with the award and we are very grateful that we had the chance to represent the Netherlands ones again in this year’s competition.</p>

<p>On fifth and sixth of January we had our annual kick-off event. Like the last few years, we did this event in the Doe Museum in Veendam. During this event the FIRST Robotics Competition officially started. A live stream was held, on which this years challenge is revealed to all the participating teams.</p>

<p>On the first day of the event we focused on discussing the different options for our robot and strategizing our plan for the challenge. We looked at all the different challenge we could encounter during the competition and choose the most effective solutions.</p>

<p>The second day we continued to explore our options we choose for the robot. We prepared everything for the coming weeks, so we can start working right away. During the second day we also did demonstrations with our robots for the kids at the museum.</p>

<p>We are excited for the upcoming weeks and wish all the other teams the best of luck for the Destination: Deep Space season.</p>
