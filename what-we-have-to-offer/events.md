Since our start as a FRC team we have been doing a lot of outreach, going to different kinds of events. To promote our team, to promote STEM and FIRST and to enthuse everyone for technology from children to adults.

We mainly do demonstrations with our robots and tell people about us and FIRST. We let children control the robots to get the best experience and also have a lot of photos and videos to show what we do. We usually use a 3D printer to make Lego bricks with our name on them and give these out to children.

We have also given courses on how to program a EV3 Brick and other topics.

If you are interested in having us at an event, feel free to [contact](/contact) us. We are looking forward to hearing from you!
