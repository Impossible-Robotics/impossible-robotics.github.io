Impossible Robotics is a non-profit organization and is financially dependant on its sponsors. Thanks to them we have been able to make good progress in developing our team. For the future we are planning to continue to develop our team, so we can give more young adults the opportunity to learn about technology in a fun and engaging way. To continue doing this we are still looking for sponsors.

We appreciate our sponsors very much, so to thank them we offer all of our sponsors a few things. We put the logos of all of our sponsors on our shirts, banners and the robots. All of which we take with us to every event we go to. Additionally, the logoâ€™s are visible on our website and we offer our sponsors the opportunity to put a short piece of text on our website about why they are sponsoring us.

Our sponsors also receive our regular newsletters and if wanted we can come to give a presentation about our team. Of course, any additional requests can be discussed.

More information can be found in the short version of our <a target="_blank" href="http://www.impossible-robotics.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Boekje-van-het-buisnessplan-kort-def.pdf">business plan</a>, at the moment this is only available in dutch. In the future, we plan on publishing a translated version as well as a full version of our business plan.

If you are interested in sponsoring us or want more information you can contact us [here](/contact).
