In our team we, among our other goals, try to create a learning platform with multiple schools and studies for our students (and mentors). We try to give everyone a chance to do and learn what they want, while also giving them an opportunity to try new things. This can for example vary from designing, programming and building, to getting experience in Media, PR and outreach. Things like organising, planning, teamwork and leadership are also a big part of being in a FRC team. Aside from the countless things you can learn in a FRC team, you also get a chance to see different places and get international friends and contacts.

We are a small, but fun team and we always welcome creativity. If you are interested in joining us then feel free to send us a message. We are looking forward to challenge the impossible together!
