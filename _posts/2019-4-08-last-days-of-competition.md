On day 5 and 6 we played our last six qualification matches. Before every round, we resolved issues with software and mechanical on our robot. In our last qualification match, our robot worked perfectly. We did not make it to the playoffs, but we had the best of times. We even got to meet Woodie Flowers and his wife at our pit. The best part was reserved for last. We received the first place award for International Enthusiasm. We are very happy with the award and we are very grateful that we had the chance to represent the Netherlands ones again in this yearâ€™s competition.
