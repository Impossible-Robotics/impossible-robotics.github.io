Over the last few weeks we have worked on our Chairman’s essay. Chairman’s is one of the most prestigious awards in the FIRST Robotics Competition, it honors the team that best represents a model for other teams to emulate and best embodies the mission of FIRST. To participate in Chairman’s a team has to write an essay, make a video and give a presentation.

In [our essay][essay]{:target="_blank"} you can read about our efforts to spread FIRST in the netherlands and the impact we have had on our community. We will continue working on the other aspects of Chairman’s and are excited to share more in the future.
