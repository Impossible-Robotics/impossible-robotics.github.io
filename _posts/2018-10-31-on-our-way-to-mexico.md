With this yearâ€™s FIRST Global Challenge starting in just two days we went on our way early in the morning to catch our flight to Mexico city.

Sadly, our flight had to be canceled because of technical issues. We ended up spending most of the day waiting at the airport before being able to go to a hotel and get some sleep.

Luckily, we will be able to fly to Mexico tomorrow and we should arrive on time for the competition. We are looking forward to meeting all the other teams there and wish everyone the best of luck in the upcoming games.
